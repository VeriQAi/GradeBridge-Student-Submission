## The Problem This Solves

**Traditional student submissions:** Inconsistent formatting, broken equations, messy PDFs that are nightmare to grade.

**GradeBridge workflow:** Students get guided, structured submission forms that auto-generate perfectly formatted PDFs for graders.

This is **Part 2** of the complete GradeBridge workflow:
1. **[Assignment Maker](https://github.com/VeriQAi/GradeBridge-Assignment-Maker)** - Instructors create structured assignments 
2. **Student Submission** (this app) - Students complete work and generate grading-ready PDFs

**The Result:** No more "my formatting broke" excuses. Professional, consistent submissions that make grading 50% faster.

## Gradescope Coordination

GradeBridge-Student-Submission PDFs are designed to match **Assignment Maker** template PDFs for Gradescope auto-grading.

**Critical Requirements**:
- One page per subsection
- Consistent headers on all pages
- Image answers get dedicated pages
- Matching problem/subsection numbering

See [GRADESCOPE_COORDINATION.md](./GRADESCOPE_COORDINATION.md) for detailed technical specifications.

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Generation Fails

**Cause**: `html2pdf` library failed to load from CDN
**Solution**: Check internet connection, refresh page, try different browser

### LaTeX Not Rendering

**Cause**: KaTeX library failed to load from CDN
**Solution**: Check internet connection, refresh page

### Lost Work After Closing Browser

**Cause**: Data was not saved or localStorage was cleared
**Solution**: Always export JSON backups before closing. Check browser settings for localStorage persistence.

### Assignment Won't Load

**Cause**: Invalid JSON format
**Solution**: Verify JSON file is valid (use a JSON validator). Ensure file was generated by Assignment Maker.

### Images Too Large

**Cause**: Uploaded images exceed recommended size
**Solution**: Compress images before uploading. Use JPG instead of PNG for photos.

## Development

### Code Style

- TypeScript with strict type checking
- Functional React components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS classes (embedded in JSX)
- ESLint/Prettier recommended (not enforced)

### Key Dependencies

- **react** and **react-dom**: UI framework
- **lucide-react**: Icon library
- **@vitejs/plugin-react**: Vite React plugin

## Browser Compatibility

Tested and working on:

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

**Not recommended**: Internet Explorer (not supported)

## Known Issues

1. **Page breaks in PDF**: Complex layouts may have imperfect page breaks (html2pdf limitation)
2. **Large images**: PDFs with many large images may take 10-20 seconds to generate
3. **Mobile devices**: Optimized for desktop/laptop use; mobile experience is functional but not ideal

## Roadmap

Potential future enhancements:

- [ ] Dark mode
- [ ] Offline PWA support
- [ ] Better mobile responsiveness
- [ ] In-browser PDF preview without library dependency
- [ ] Assignment validation (check for required fields)
- [ ] Multi-language support
