## The Problem

**Traditional submissions:** Inconsistent formatting, broken equations, messy PDFs that are a nightmare to grade.

**GradeBridge workflow:** Guided, structured submission forms that auto-generate perfectly formatted PDFs.

**The two-app workflow:**
1. **[Assignment Maker](https://github.com/VeriQAi/GradeBridge-Assignment-Maker)** - Instructors create structured assignments
2. **Student Submission** (this app) - Students complete work and generate grading-ready PDFs

**Result:** No more "my formatting broke" excuses. Consistent submissions that make grading 50% faster.

## Assignment JSON Format

Assignments are created using the **[Assignment Maker](https://github.com/VeriQAi/GradeBridge-Assignment-Maker)**:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-id",
  "courseCode": "ECE416",
  "title": "Mini-Project 1",
  "dueDate": "2024-12-01",
  "dueTime": "23:59",
  "preamble": "Instructions for the entire assignment...",
  "problems": [
    {
      "id": "prob-1",
      "name": "System Analysis",
      "description": "Analyze the following system...",
      "subsections": [
        {
          "id": "prob-1-a",
          "name": "Transfer Function",
          "description": "Derive the transfer function",
          "points": 5,
          "submissionType": "Text",
          "maxImages": 0
        },
        {
          "id": "prob-1-b",
          "name": "Step Response",
          "description": "Plot the step response",
          "points": 5,
          "submissionType": "Image",
          "maxImages": 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "createdAt": 1700000000000,
  "updatedAt": 1700000000000
}
```

## Data & Privacy

- All data stored in browser localStorage
- No server communication, no analytics, no account required
- Data persists across browser restarts
- **Always export JSON backups** - data is lost if you clear browser cache

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Assignment won't load | Verify JSON was exported from Assignment Maker |
| LaTeX not rendering | Refresh page; KaTeX loads from CDN |
| PDF generation fails | Check internet; html2pdf loads from CDN |
| Lost work | Always export JSON backups regularly |
| Images too large | Compress images; use JPG instead of PNG |

---

## Gradescope Integration

PDFs are designed to match Assignment Maker templates:
- One page per subsection
- Consistent headers on all pages
- Image answers get dedicated pages

See [GRADESCOPE_COORDINATION.md](./GRADESCOPE_COORDINATION.md) for technical details.

## Development

### Tech Stack
React 19 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS + KaTeX (CDN) + html2pdf.js (CDN)

### Build & Deploy
```bash
npm run build      # Production build
npm run deploy     # Deploy to GitHub Pages
```

---

## Known Limitations

- **CDN Dependencies** - KaTeX and html2pdf.js load from CDN; internet required for LaTeX rendering and PDF generation
- **Long Text Answers** - Very long answers that exceed one page may have imperfect breaks (html2pdf limitation)
- **Mobile Experience** - Optimized for desktop; functional but not ideal on phones

## Browser Support

Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
